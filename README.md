<h3>Happiness Score Prediction</h3>
This repository contains the research and implementation of predicting happiness scores using Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression models. The study, conducted by Tzu Wang at Queen Mary University of London, aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the overall satisfaction levels across various countries, aiding in effective policy-making and resource allocation.

<h3>Overview</h3>
The research employs two primary datasets from the 2018 and 2019 happiness reports available on Kaggle, focusing on six key factors: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. The project applies Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression to forecast happiness scores, offering insights into the predictive power of these models.
